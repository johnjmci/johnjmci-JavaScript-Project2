## Background
This project presents an online quiz based on the popular televisiion show The US Office. 
Players are presented with a deck of ten questions to test their knowledge of the show, its storylines, and characters. 

The site is intended to be simple to use, interactive and visually appealing. The structure of the quiz invites and enables players to play again and again to try and achieve a perfect score. 

## Features & Format
The site contains two main sections:
1) The landing page and playing area.
2) The results page, providing feedback to players. 

## Branding
Branding of the site has been kept intentionally minimal. This is intended to contribute to the simplistic and easy to use nature of the site. 

The colours and fonts have been selected to pay tribute to the aesthetic of the television show and appeal to fans of the show, who will experience a sense of familiarity when engaging with the site. 

Fonts - The site uses the Special Elite font family and Helvetica, sourced from Google fonts. 

Font colour - The font colour used is black. This has been informed and amended from a previous choice by review of colour performance using WAVE web accessibility tool.

Colour palette - The main background colour used is light blue, with text boxes being white.

## Design Approach and User Experience
The approach to the design of the site has been informed by reference to the five planes of user experience design. 
1. Strategy -
a) For users of the site - create a site which is simple to use and interact with. 
b) For site owners - create a site which is simple to maintain and includes scopefor future upgrades and advancements. 
2. Scope - The site focuses on one subject area and allows users to submit answers via a multiple choice functionality. 
3. Structure - The site bookends the user experience with a welcome message describing the game and a feedback message confiming the user's level of success. 
4. Skeleton - The siteâ€™s design reflects the multiple choice format of the quiz. The style of the quiz and feedback function encourage users to complete the time multiple times in the course of achieving a better or perfect score. 
5. Surface - The appearance of the site has been intentionally kept minimal, this is in part so as not to distract user's from quickly understanding the functionality fo the site and engaging with the content of the questions being posed. 

## Completed Features
Descriptions here highlight value to first-time, returning and frequent visitors to the site.

## Testing
Code Validation: 
HTML - No errors currently found when code passed through the official W3C validator
CSS - No errors currently found when code passed through the official W3C Jigsaw validator
JavaScript - No errors currently found when code passed through the JSHint validator

Work completed to fix and bugs and errors flagged via all three validators during testing of the site. 

Accessibility - Review completed via WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool. 

Mobile Optimisation - The site has been optimised to display correctly on desktop, tablet and mobile screen sizes. Key amendments here related to the sizing of text boxes when being shown on smaler screens. Images and font sizes also adjusted to display at legible and proportion dimensions. 

User testing - As well as displaying the website on desktop, tablet and mobile screens, a third-party was requested to access and use the site. Amendments made as a result of testing and user feedback:

Text found to be spilling outside of text areas when displayed on mobile phones.

Also flagged that the length of some pieces of question and feedback text were too long fr the dimension of the elements housing them.
